**Added:** None

**Changed:**
 * publist builder now makes a version of the publication list without the main
   author appearing in bold (_nobold), a version that is pandoc friendly (_pandoc)
   so it can be converted to MS word and other formats, and a version that also
   prints the acknowledgement statement along with the reference (in a slightly
   clunky fashion, _ackno) as well as the previously produced publication list.

**Deprecated:** None

**Removed:** None

**Fixed:** None

**Security:** None
